# Project Documentation

I spoke with the professor during office hours, and he inquired as to my motivation for this project. I explained that I had been inspired while playing text-based games, and he suggested that I use existing language models such as GPT-3 to improve text-based games rather than attempting to basically reproduce a chatbot. So instead of just creating a software application that uses sentiment analysis and pattern matching to rank the appropriateness of follow-up reactions to question-answer pairs, I have pivoted to the aforementioned topic.

## Main Results

- [ ] Source Code
 - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MAT1Jzh2zQUpkCU0pKWeR9_FqM4SlvTc?usp=sharing
- [ ] Demo
 - A demo that shows your code can actually run and generate the desired results. If there is a training process involved, you donâ€™t need to show that process during the demo. If your code takes too long to run, try to optimize it, or write some intermediate results (e.g. inverted index, trained model parameters, etc.) to disk beforehand.
- [ ] Self Evaluation
 - Have you completed what you have planned? Have you got the expected outcome? If not, discuss why.
