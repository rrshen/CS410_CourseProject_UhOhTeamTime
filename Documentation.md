# Project Documentation

I spoke with the professor during office hours, and he inquired as to my motivation for this project. I explained that I had been inspired while playing text-based games, and he suggested that I use existing language models such as GPT-3 to improve text-based games rather than attempting to basically reproduce a chatbot. So instead of just creating a software application that uses sentiment analysis and pattern matching to rank the appropriateness of follow-up reactions to question-answer pairs, I have pivoted to the aforementioned topic.
