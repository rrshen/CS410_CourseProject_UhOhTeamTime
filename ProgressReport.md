## Challenges

Because this is a niche topic, there don't seem to be any available databases for pairings or rankings. I had to create my corpus and potential 'queries' myself and present all of the options in a way that would allow people to rank them. Adding each new response and reaction took about five minutes by the time I reached a point I deemed satisfactory, and I only have a single question with 24 potential answers and 13 potential reactions to the answers.
